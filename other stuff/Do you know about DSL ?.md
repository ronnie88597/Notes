# Do you know about DSL?

â€‹	A [domain-specific-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)(DSL) is a computer language specialized to particular application domain. This is in contrast to a [general-purpost language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language)(GPL), which is broadly applicable across domains. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only one or a few pieces of software, such as MUSH soft code. DSLs can be further subdivided by the kind of language, and include domain-specific [markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language), domain-specific [modeling languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeling_language) (more generally, specification languages), and domain-specific programming languages. Special-purpose computer languages have alway existed in the computer age, but the term "domain-specific language" has been more popular due to the rise of [domain-specific modeling]. Simpler DSLs, particularly ones used by a single application, are sometimes informally called mini-languages.
