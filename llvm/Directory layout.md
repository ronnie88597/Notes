The following is a brief introduction to code layout.

## llvm-project/clang

​	[Clang][ http://clang.llvm.org/ ] is an "llvm native" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles (e.g. about [3x faster than GCC][http://clang.llvm.org/features.html#performance] when compiling Objective-C code in a debug configuration), extremely useful [error and warning messages][http://clang.llvm.org/diagnostics.html] and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The [Clang Static Analyzer][http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/] is a tool that automatically finds bugs in your code, and is great example of the sort of tool that can be built using the Clang frontend as library to parse C/C++ code.

## llvm-project/clang-tools-extra

​	This repository holds tools that are developed as a part of the LLVM compiler infrastructure project and the Clang frontend. The tools are kept in a seperate "extra" repository to allow lighter weight checkouts of the core Clang codebase.

​	This repository is only intended to be checked out inside of a full LLVM+Clang tree, and in the 'tool/extra' subdirectory of the Clang checkout.

​	All discussing regarding Clang, Clang-based tools, and code in this repository should be held using the standard Clang mailing lists:	http://lists.llvm.org/mailman/listinfo/cfe-dev

## llvm-project/compiler-rt

​	The [compiler-rt][http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/] project provides highly tuned implementations of the low-level code generator support routines like "__fixunsdfdi" and other calls generated when a target doesn't have a short sequence of native instructions to implement a core IR operation. It also provides implementations of run-time libraries for dynamic testing tools such as [AdressSanitizer][http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html], [ThreadSanitizer][http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html], [MemorySanitizer][http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html], and [DataFlowSanitizer][http://clang.llvm.org/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.html]

## llvm-project/debuginfo-tests

​	This is a collection of tests to check debugging information generated by compiler. This test suite can be checked out inside clang/test folder. This will enable 'make test' for clang to pick up these tests. Typically, test cases included here includes debugger commands and intended debugger output as comments in source file using DEBUGGER: and CHECK: as prefixes respectively:

​	For example:

```asm
define i32 @f1(i32 %i) nounwing ssp{
	; DEBUGGER: break f1
	; DEBUGGER: r
	; DEBUGGER: p i
	; CHECK: $1 = 42
	entry:
}
```

 is a testcase where the debugger is asked to break at function 'f1' and print value of argument 'i'. The expected value of 'i' is 42 in this case.

## llvm-project/libclc

​	The [libclc][http://libclc.llvm.org/] project aim to implement the OpenCL standard library.

## llvm-project/libcxx & llvm-project/libcxxabi

​	The [libc++][http://libcxx.llvm.org/] and [libc++ ABI][http://libcxxabi.llvm.org/] projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ standard library, include full support for C++ 11 and C++ 14.

## llvm-project/libunwind

​	libunwind is an implementation of the interface defined by the HP libunwind project. It was contributed by Apple as a way to enable clang++ to port to platforms that do not have a system unwinder. It is intended to be a small and fast  implementation of  the ABI, leaving off some features of HP's libunwind that never materialized(e.g. remote unwinding).

## llvm-project/lld

​	The [LLD][http://lld.llvm.org/] project is a new linker. That is a drop-in replacement of system linkers and runs much faster.

## llvm-project/lldb

​	The [LLDB][http://lldb.llvm.org/] project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger. It uses the Clang ASTs and expression parser, LLVM JIT, LLVM disassembler, etc  so that it provides an experience that "just works". It is also blazing fast and much more memory efficient than GDB at loading symbols.

## llvm-project/llgo

​	llgo is a Go(http://golang.org) frontend for llvm, written in Go.

​	llgo is under active development. It compiles and passes most of the standard library test suited and a substantial portion of the gc test suits, but there are some corner cases that are known not to be handled correctly yet. Nevertheless it can compile modestly substantial programs (including itself; it is self hosting on x86-64 Linux).

## llvm-project/openmp

​	The [OpenMP][http://openmp.llvm.org/] subproject provides an OpenMP runtime for use with the OpenMP implementation in Clang.

## llvm-project/parallel-libs

​	The LLVM open source project will contain a subproject named parallel-libs which will host the development of libraries which are aimed at enabling parallelism in code and which are also closely tied to compiler tied to compiler technology. Examples of libraries suitable for hosting within the parallel-libs subproject are runtime libraries and parallel math libraries. The initial candidates for inclusion in this subproject are **Stream Executor** and **libomptarget** which would live in the streamexecutor and libomptarget subdirectories of parallel-libs, respectively.

## llvm-project/polly

​	The [polly][http://polly.llvm.org/] project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.

## llvm-project/pstl

​	Parallel STL is an implementation of the C++ standard library algorithms with support for execution policies, as specified in ISO/IEC 14882:2017 standard, commonly called C++17. The implementation also supports the unsequenced execution policy specified in Parallelism TS version 2 and proposed for the next version of C++ standard in the C++ working group paper [P1001](https://wg21.link/p1001).

​	Parallel STL offers efficient support for both parallel and vectorized execution of algorithm. For sequential execution, it relies on an available implementation of the C++ standard library.

## llvm-project/llvm

​	This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for LLVM, a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and runtime environments.

​	LLVM is open source software. You may freely distribute it under the terms of the license agreement found in LICENSE.txt.	

​	Please see the documentation provided in docs/ for further assistance with LLVM, and in particular docs/GettingStarted.rst for getting started with LLVM and docs/README.txt for and overview of LLVM's documentation setup.
